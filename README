This is my master's thesis' latex code, which I started in February 2011. 

Its title will most probably be "Computation and Visualization of Subjective Artist Similarity for Music Libraries on Android Devices", and it is about building an Android prototype for music library visualization (as the title suggests). I have yet to decide whether I put up the source code for the public.

The thesis is currently work in progress.
