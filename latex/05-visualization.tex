\section{Visualization of Artist Similarity}

There are visualization-only aspects to graph based layouts which can be formulated as the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How are edges between objects displayed, or are they displayed at all?
	\item How are intersecting edges dealt with?
	\item How are objects presented?
	\item How are dissimilarities scaled to geometric distances (linearly, exponentially, logarithmically,...)?
	\item How is perfect (or near-perfect) similarity displayed (overlapping objects, minimum edge length,...)?
\end{itemize}

They can be viewed as implementation subtleties.
