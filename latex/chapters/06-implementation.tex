\section{Assembly of Algorithms and Information Flow In Concrete Implemention}
\label{sec:algorithm-assembly}

In section ~\ref{ch:scenario}, an overview was given of how algorithms work together in the system. In-depth implementation-specific details of this assembly and information flow will now be given.

\subsection{Library Visualization}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Extraction of music metadata on the device \\\\
			\textbf{Input:} Access cursor to a data store containing the device's music library metadata.  \\

		\subitem Building up of a distance matrix between artists \\\\
				\textbf{Input:} Complete artist similarity relations stored in the app's database. \\
				\textbf{Algorithm:} Iterates through all artist similarity relations, calculates a

				indicates their similarity to each other. \\
				\textbf{Algorithm:} Empties out the graph, and re-adds the artist nodes back into it, one by one,
				while optionally moving nodes when they are added such that they do not overlap any other nodes. This
				movement is determined by the vector of both node's center coordinates and their amount
				of overlapping. For more details about this algorithm, see 
				~\ref{subch:implementation-overlapping} later in this section. \\

\end{itemize}

				calculation does not stop for those. \\
				\textbf{Output:} - \\
\end{itemize}

\section{Algorithm Illustrations}

The previously described algorithms used for the composition of the App will in the following be  illustrated by screenshots of their outcome. These screenshots are based on an example library which the author of this thesis used while debugging and testing the App. Many of the states depicted on the screenshots are not to be found in the actual App, because during the computational algorithms the current graph state is hidden from the user. Only ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_10_after_all_uncollided_nodes} could be a screenshot of the final version of the App. The other figures serve as pure illustration for this thesis.

\subsection{Before Computation}

In figure ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_1_initial}, the initial graph state is shown - a loose collection of artist nodes strewn around the graph's origin in a random manner. At this point, no computation has yet been performed except the assignment of random positions (to avoid edge cases during the application of spring model forces later on, which arise when all nodes are located at the origin).

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/screen_mds_1_initial}
  \caption{The initial graph state before MDS calculation}
  \label{fig:screen_mds_1_initial}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{After 5 Subset Iterations (MDS)}
\label{subsec:mds-after-five-subset-iterations}

As previously described in sections ~\ref{sec:mds-algorithm} and ~\ref{sec:algorithm-assembly}, the first steps in the App's MDS computation are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Generation of a subset of nodes, and
	\item Application of a number of spring model iterations on this subset.
\end{enumerate}

The screenshot depicted in figure ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_2_after_5_subset_iterations} shows the graph's state after five iterations of step 2. If compared to figure ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_1_initial}, it can be observed that four of the artist nodes have been moved to more outward positions.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/screen_mds_2_after_5_subset_iterations}
  \caption{Graph state after 5 iterations of the initial subset}
  \label{fig:screen_mds_2_after_5_subset_iterations}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{After 20 Subset Iterations (MDS)}

Similar to the previous figure, the following screenshot ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_3_after_20_subset_iterations} shows graph state during the second step (application of a number of spring model iterations on the initial subset) of MDS computation, but with 20 iterations of progress. It's easy to see that the four artist nodes (which have already been moved in figure ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_2_after_5_subset_iterations}) have been displaced even more.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/screen_mds_3_after_20_subset_iterations}
  \caption{Graph state after 20 spring force iterations of the initial subset}
  \label{fig:screen_mds_3_after_20_subset_iterations}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{After 5 Placements of Remaining Nodes (MDS)}

After spring model forces have been applied to the initial node subset, the remaining nodes (not being in the initial subset) are now placed in semantically sane positions. In figure ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_4_after_5_restnode_additions}, it can be observed that some nodes visible on the screen have been moved to positions which differ greatly from the old positions in the last screenshot. Because the placement algorithm is of low complexity, as has been shown in section ~\ref{subsec:mds-selected-algorithm}, placements are performed in much shorter time than the previously described subset iterations.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/screen_mds_4_after_5_restnode_additions}
  \caption{Graph state after 5 placements of nodes outside the initial subset}
  \label{fig:screen_mds_4_after_5_restnode_additions}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{After All Placements of Remaining Nodes (MDS)}

Figure ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_5_after_all_restnode_additions} shows the graph's state after all nodes not in the initial subset have been placed in approximated positions. Although all nodes have been displaced at least once, this is an intermediate state, not yet resembling the algorithm's final outcome. Most nodes should be at least near their optimal position, minimizing system stress, but tests have shown that some nodes will be displaced by much in the following placement corrections. Due to the nature of the performed placement approximation, the such placed nodes take into account only the most similar node - yet there may be other nodes at an entirely different position in the graph to which the placed node is also similar.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/screen_mds_5_after_all_restnode_additions}
  \caption{Graph state after placements of all nodes outside the initial subset}
  \label{fig:screen_mds_5_after_all_restnode_additions}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{After 5 Placement Correction Iterations (MDS)}

Similar to the beginning of the calculations (depicted in section ~\ref{subsec:mds-after-five-subset-iterations}), the spring model algorithm is again applied to the graph, but on all nodes at once. The previously approximated positions for many of the nodes have to be corrected (i.e., system stress has to be reduced) for the produced layout to increase significance. Some or many of the nodes are even at the wrong side of the graph, judging by the forces enacted by all other nodes. Application of a limited number of spring model iterations has the potential to improve the expressiveness of the layout greatly. Figure ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_6_after_5_cleanup_iterations} displays graph state after five spring model iterations.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/screen_mds_6_after_5_cleanup_iterations}
  \caption{Graph state after 5 spring model iterations of all nodes}
  \label{fig:screen_mds_6_after_5_cleanup_iterations}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{After 10 Placement Correction Iterations (MDS)}
\label{subsec:mds-after-ten-placement-iterations}

After 10 spring model iterations, the resulting layout is supposed to sufficiently satisfy the graph's similarity forces. The result is shown in figure ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_7_after_10_cleanup_iterations}, which also resembles the final outcome of the MDS algorithm. 
The graph's nodes have been laid out such that their centers' positions reduce system stress - not giving any heed to overlappings. Therefore, the process does not end here, but these overlappings have to be eliminated.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/screen_mds_7_after_10_cleanup_iterations}
  \caption{Graph state after 10 spring force iterations of all nodes}
  \label{fig:screen_mds_7_after_10_cleanup_iterations}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{After Removal of Node Overlappings from 5 Nodes}

By applying the anti-overlap algorithm described in section ~\ref{sec:removal-node-overlapping}, overlapping artist nodes are separated from each other. Figure ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_8_after_5_uncollided_nodes} shows the graph's state after five nodes have been processed, i.e. they have been repositioned such that they keep a certain margin to any other nodes.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/screen_mds_8_after_5_uncollided_nodes}
  \caption{Graph state after removal of node overlappings from 5 nodes}
  \label{fig:screen_mds_8_after_5_uncollided_nodes}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{After Removal of Node Overlappings from Half of All Nodes}

As a continuation of the last screenshot, the following figure ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_9_after_half_uncollided_nodes} depicts the graph's state after half of all artist nodes have been repositioned to avoid overlappings.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/screen_mds_9_after_half_uncollided_nodes}
  \caption{Graph state after removal of node overlappings from half of all nodes}
  \label{fig:screen_mds_9_after_half_uncollided_nodes}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{After Removal of Node Overlappings from All Nodes}

Screenshot ~\ref{fig:screen_mds_10_after_all_uncollided_nodes} shows the final state of the graph, at the end of all computations. This is a compromise between the intermediate result shown in subsection ~\ref{subsec:mds-after-ten-placement-iterations}, and a user-friendly (easy to grasp) representation of the graph. Clearly, system stress has been increased by removal of node overlappings; but, the process has made the MDS algorithm's results readable and easily understandable. The resulting margin between the nodes is subject to adjustable parameters, leaving room for further optimization.

In the actual App implementation, this is the first state displayed to the user - all previous states are hidden from her. Subsequently, the App reacts to touch gestures in order to enable navigation and exploration of the structure on small screens (it's understood that screenshot~\ref{fig:screen_mds_10_after_all_uncollided_nodes} does not show all artists of the graph).

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/screen_mds_10_after_all_uncollided_nodes}
  \caption{Graph state after removal of node overlappings from all nodes}

\end{figure}

\section{Retrieval of Music Metadata}

\subsection{Querying of Music Metadata on the Device}

Android has a cursor-based query system for multimedia metadata (kept up-to-date transparently by the
operation system). Creation of a cursor for all artists on the device is performed by program code like this:

\begin{verbatim}
Cursor artistCursor = mContext.getContentResolver().query(
	MediaStore.Audio.Artists.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI,
    artistProjection, null, null, null);
\end{verbatim}

Since the returned metadata also contains a unique key for each multimedia file, metadata can be
persisted in a database (disconnected from the VM's memory) and later be reused without obstacles.
Metadata records themselves contain as much data as the user or the file-generating utility has defined
before the file was copied onto the device - clearly, files may not have any metadata available at all.

In the implementation of the App, such a cursor is traversed over all available music titles, and several entities are derived:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Artist,
	\item Album, and
	\item Track.
\end{itemize}

While these entities are created, the implementation checks whether they already exist, and skips creation accordingly. Retrieved data is then stored in the App's on-device database.

\subsection{Retrieval of Music Metadata from Websources}

Last.fm \cite{url:lastfm} and Echonest \cite{url:echonest} are the defacto standards for music metadata retrieval in the world wide web, 
at the time of writing of this paper. The author has chosen to use both of these services for retrieval 
of semantic metadata for the implementation. 

After the device's music titles and their metadata have been retrieved, their metadata has to be augmented or corrected with the normalized data from external sources - Last.fm and Echonest. To ensure a stable mapping from on-device to remote music metadata records, these are fetched up front. For every artist, album, and track the App has retrieved from the device, a match is searched for in web sources. Search for matches is performed by sending an ordinary search query to the web sources, and metadata records are returned as a result. Excerpts of the acquired records are then stored in the App's on-device database.

\section{Retrieval of Similarity Data}

Ideally, the retrieval of similarities between artists should provide an exhaustive list of similarities between any two artists. But, as a real-world implementation must make do with actuality, workarounds had to be found which provide approximations to artist similarities.
Echonest's artist similarity results contain no similarity metric, but only the implicit ranking of artists. Therefore, the author of this thesis decided \textbf{not to use Echonest's similarity metrics}.

Last.fm's artist similarity data is, in contrast to Echonest, augmented with accurate similarity measures in the range of $[0 .. 1]$. But, it is not possible to query Last.fm for a certain similarity relationship between two certain artists - instead, the top 100 similar artists for a certain artist can be retrieved. It's clear that this way, many artist-to-artist relations in a music collection will not receive a similarity measure. Instead, a dedicated algorithm has to approximate similarity values which were not provided by Last.fm.

As Last.fm provides similarity value lists per artist ("'subject"'), it can be assumed that every relation to an artist not on the list has a similarity value within the interval \emph{[0 .. x], x = lowest known similarity of "'subject"' to any other artist}. Not having any more details at hand than this fact, the expected value of such an unknown similarity value is $x / 2$ - the author of this thesis decided to use this value as an approximation.

\subsection{Similarity Approximation Algorithm}

In the following, the algorithm to interpolate similarity values (which is being used in the App's implementation) is described in simplified Java code:

\begin{verbatim}
for (artistOnDevice : allArtistsOnDevice) {
  similarArtists = LastFM.getSimilarArtists(artistOnDevice);
  for (innerArtistOnDevice : allArtistsOnDevice) {
    if (similarArtists.size() == 0)
      lowestMatch = 0;
    else
      lowestMatch = FLOAT_MAX;
    // Iterate through all found similarity matches:
    for (artistInLastFM : similarArtists) {
      // Find the lowest similarity match in the list:
      if (artistInLastFM.getSimilarityMatch() < lowestMatch)
        lowestMatch = artistInLastFM.getSimilarityMatch();
        // match is found, save a similarity object:
      if (matches(artistInLastFM, innerArtistOnDevice)) {
        artistSimilarity = new ArtistSimilarity(artistOnDevice, 
          innerArtistOnDevice, artistInLastFM.getSimilarityMatch());
        break;
      }
    }
	
    // No similar artists were returned at all:
    if (similarArtists.size() == 0)
      ArtistSimilarity artistSimilarity = new ArtistSimilarity(artistOnDevice, 
        innerArtistOnDevice, 0);    
    // Match was not found, save interpolated similarity object:
    else if (artistSimilarity == null)
      artistSimilarity = new ArtistSimilarity(artistOnDevice, 
      innerArtistOnDevice, lowestMatch / 2.0f);

    storeSimilarityIfNotExists(artistSimilarity);
  }
}	            
	
\end{verbatim}

\section{Implementation of Multidimensional Scaling}
\label{subch:implementation-mds}

The selected MDS algorithm has already been discussed broadly in section ~\ref{ch:computation}. Implementation of this algorithm required the creation of a number of helper and data classes, but on the whole, the implementation follows the pseudocode from section ~\ref{ch:computation} closely. To better illustrate step 3. from the mentioned pseudocode, the implementational part is included in the following as simplified Java code:

\begin{verbatim}
subject: the node to be positioned near any other node
initialSubset: the initial nodes subset of size sqrt(number of all nodes)
currentSubsetNodes: the nodes subset incrementally populated 
  by all remaining nodes not in the intial subset

nearestNode = getNearestNodeToSubject(subject, currentSubsetNodes);
distanceToNearestNode = distanceMatrix.getDistanceBetween(subject, nearestNode)
    * DISTANCE_CONSTANT;

// find out which quadrant (upper-l, lower-l, upper-r, lower-r) (where
// nearestNode is point zero) is suited best for subject:
upperRightQuadrant = getPointInQuadrant(1, 1, distanceToNearestNode, nearestNode);
lowerRightQuadrant = getPointInQuadrant(1, -1, distanceToNearestNode, nearestNode);
upperLeftQuadrant = getPointInQuadrant(-1, 1, distanceToNearestNode, nearestNode);
lowerLeftQuadrant = getPointInQuadrant(-1, -1, distanceToNearestNode, nearestNode);

// Add up the forces on the four representational quadrant points, for
// comparison later on:
upperRightStress = 0, lowerRightStress = 0, upperLeftStress = 0, lowerLeftStress = 0;
for (currentSubsetNode : currentSubsetNodes) {
    upperRightStress += getStress(subject, upperRightQuadrant, currentSubsetNode);
    lowerRightStress += getStress(subject, lowerRightQuadrant, currentSubsetNode);
    upperLeftStress += getStress(subject, upperLeftQuadrant, currentSubsetNode);
    lowerLeftStress += getStress(subject, lowerLeftQuadrant, currentSubsetNode);
}

// Find the quadrant point with the minimal stress, and move the subject
// there:
minStress = Min(Min(upperLeftStress, upperRightStress),
    Min(lowerLeftStress, lowerRightStress));
if (upperRightStress == minStress)
    subject.setPosition(upperRightQuadrant);
else if (lowerRightStress == minStress)
    subject.setPosition(lowerRightQuadrant);
else if (upperLeftStress == minStress)
    subject.setPosition(upperLeftQuadrant);
else
    subject.setPosition(lowerLeftQuadrant);

for (int i = 1; i <= QUADRANT_REFINING_ITERATIONS; i++) {
    // Improve on the quadrant point position by selecting a subset of
    // the initial graph subset, and reposition the subject such that
    // the stress between them and the subject is lowered:
    sumOfForcesOnSubject = new VirtualVector(0, 0);
    for (initialSubsetNode : initialSubset)
        sumOfForcesOnSubject.addVector(forceBetweenNodes(subject, initialSubsetNode));
    displaceNode(subject, sumOfForcesOnSubject);
}

currentSubsetNodes.add(subject);
	
\end{verbatim}

\section{Implementation of Removal of Node Overlappings}
\label{subch:implementation-overlapping}

The algorithm used for the removal of node overlappings has been shown in section ~/ref{ch:visualization}. The actual implementation required some pragmatic changes, therefore the code is listed in the following in simplified Java:

\begin{verbatim}
allNodes: all artists within the graph
nodesWithoutOverlap: artists within the graph which do not overlap with other artists
iterationsCount: number of iterations allowed to find a new position for one artist
nodesSize: diagonal through an artist's depiction square 
  (i.e., sqrt(x^2 + x^2) | x = artist node width and height), the maximally needed displacement
  to separate two overlapped artist nodes.
	
for (subjectNode : allNodes) {
  // move subjectNode around to find an empty spot for it among nodesWithoutOverlap
  for (i = 0; i < iterationsCount; i++) {
    for (collisionCandidate : nodesWithoutOverlap) {
      nodeCentersDistance = subjectNode.getEuclideanDistanceTo(collisionCandidate);
      randomMargin = random();
      if (nodeCentersDistance < nodesSize + randomMargin) {
        subjectNodeDisplacementVector = collisionCandidate.getVectorTo(subjectNode);
        subjectNodeDisplacementVector.setLength(nodesSize - nodeCentersDistance + random()); 
        subjectNode.move(subjectNodeDisplacementVector);
      }
    }
  }
  nodesWithoutOverlap.add(subjectNode);
}
\end{verbatim}

The optimized algorithm has a predefined number of iterations, by the end of which a node should no longer overlap any other nodes. This number has to be chosen carefully - too high and the overall computation duration will increase linearly, too low and not all node overlappings will be removed.

\section{Visualization Details}

Apart from the previously described computational algorithms, the App features a number of components or behaviour not contained in the Android operating system. In the following, the most interesting features aiding the visualization of content will be described.

\subsection{Drawing with OpenGL}

Android provides App developers with the possibility to implement threedimensional viewports in OpenGL ES \cite{url:opengles}, which is a downsized version of ordinary OpenGL and meant for implementation in handheld devices. OpenGL is a specification which is used as a blueprint by operating systems vendors and GPU producers alike. An OpenGL context can be seen as a state-machine which is manipulated by external API calls.

In order to be able to employ OpenGL for graph rendering, the author of this thesis had to create a number of abstract metaclasses and find a way to resemble user interactions in the drawn 3D picture. As mentioned before, the objective was to draw pseudo-2D, such that all music objects are displayed as pictures, viewed from the top. Accordingly, the viewport has to move sideways when the user moves one finger over the touchscreen, and it has to change its distance to the graph objects when the user zooms.

\subsection{Touchscreen Handling}

With the advent of smartphones, strong conventions have been established by phone vendors which determine how users may interact with the smartphone. Touchscreen technology provides a more immediate way of interaction than previous systems, allowing users to seemingly interact with the very objects they want to manipulate (as opposed to moving views and cursors with hardware buttons).
There are three touchscreen gestures supported by the App's implementation:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Panning/Scrolling} - The user taps the finger onto the screen surface, does not let 
	go, and pulls the finger across the surface. As long as the finger does not part from the surface, 
	the "'pan/scroll"' is active.
	\item \textbf{Zooming} - The user rests two fingers on the screen surface, and changes the distance
	between her finger tips. If the distance decreases, then the zoom factor will increase; and vice versa.
	Ideally, the touched points would always stay right under the user's finger tips, but in the built
	App prototype, this has not been achieved, because of the threedimensional nature of the OpenGL
	rendering process.
	\item \textbf{Tapping} - The user taps her finger onto the screen surface at a point on which the
	desired object is located, and lets go again immediately. The App then reacts to this interaction
	with an adequate response or action, depending on the current state of the user interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Animations}

To make transitions between view states in the App smoother and easier to follow for users, animations have been implemented to do so. It has been shown in an empirical study that comprehension of changes can be improved by adding animations ~\cite{Schlienger:2007}.

\textbf{Whole-screen transition} - If the user chooses to display an artist's albums, the transition to the next Activity (fullscreen Android layout component) is implemented as a fade-over animation, meaning that the second screen is added as an overlay and its alpha channel is animated from 0 to 1. This way, the user is able to notice the change of context without being disturbed by untracable changes.

\textbf{Artist Node animation} - If the user selects an artist by tapping, the artist's image depiction is moved on the z-axis towards the virtual camera - appearing nearer to the viewport. This puts an emphasis on the selected artist and makes for a pleasing optical effect. As OpenGL is a high-level framework, animations like this have to be implemented by the developer - keeping track of animation start and projected end time, and determining the state for every newly drawn frame.

\textbf{Context-related graph area darkening} - If the user chooses to display an artist's related (similar) artists, the graph area darkens over all other currently displayed artists, to put an emphasis on the selected artist and its related artists. This effect is achieving by adding a rectangle between the emphasized artists and the others, which is at first transparent and then gains opacity through an animation.

\subsection{About Android Apps}

Android is a mobile operating system developed by the Open Handset Alliance ~\cite{url:openhandsetalliance}, led by Google. Its architecture allows for 3rd party programs (called "'apps"') to easily be run and debugged on Android devices.
Android apps are run in the Dalvik VM which makes use of a register-based architecture, relying on a Linux kernel for low-level functionality ~\cite{dalvik}. The most wide-spread programming language for building Android apps is Java, but various other languages such as Scala or even scripting languages like Groovy or Lua can be used. Since mid 2009, developers can also write and integrate native C and C++ code by making use of the Native Development Kit (NDK).

From an app developer's perspective, the frameworks contained in Android dictate a user-centric application structure, made up of so-called Activities ~\cite{url:androidactivity}. Every Activity encapsulates a screen which is presented to the user. Activities are loosely coupled, allowing only serialized objects and primitive values to be passed between them.

User interface composition in Android is performed partly in the CPU (e.g., in Java code), and partly in the device's GPU (by using the OpenGL interface). Apps can also choose between these composition variants.

Android is a strictly touch-centric operating system, meaning that most user interactions are performed via the device's touch screen. Originally, Android devices were bound to provide hardware buttons, but starting with Android 4.0, those buttons are gradually replaced with software buttons (displayed on the touch screen).
