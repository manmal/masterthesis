\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I want to thank Prof. Andreas Rauber for making this thesis possible, and my mentor and friend Tom Lidy for providing crucial feedback and support when I needed it - and for staying with me and this thesis when it delayed.
\\\\
I wish to thank my parents for all their loving support throughout my studies, allowing me to finally complete "'project university"' which I started way back in 2005.
\\\\
And I want to thank my partner Bianca, for just being there and calmly listening to my worries whenever something did not work out as I wanted it to, and for giving me strength when I needed it.

Thank you!
